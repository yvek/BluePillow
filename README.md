=====

Blue Pillow is a Android app built over MVVM. It takes a world name as input and adds it into the local storage of device.

## Concepts implemented

* `MVVM` architecture pattern
* `Data Binding` with custom attributes such as ```xml app:imageUrl```
* `Room` library
* `HILT` *Dependency Injection* for loading objects such as Retrofit client, Database, Repositories, Viewmodels etc

 
### Explaination

The project started with simple Hello world. You can type the world name. You will see a list of worlds that are in DB.

The list is displayed using *RecyclerView* that is built with *LiveData*. Hence the list is always containing the latest data.


### UI Layer
* Activity 
  - *ImageView* that loads an image from the internet using custom attribute 
  ```
  app:imageUrl = "url"
  app:placeholder = "@{@drawable/...}
  app:error = "@{@drawable/..." 
  ``` 
  - *EditText* & a *Button* to save new world name in database 
  - *RecyclerView* displays list of worlds.
  
* ViewModel that exposes *Immutable* data to Activity layout.

### Data Layer
* Database Room with LiveData

### Dependency Injection using HILT

### Architecture Component
* DataBinding 
  - Viewmodel data in layout
  - Custom attributes with `@BindingAdapter`

### Whats currently cooking
* Utilities - upload image
* Network Module - fetch images from server
* Test module
